# Self-Host-Boiler-Plates
I have spent a decent amount of time spinning up some services to self-host on my home server through docker-compose. This list isn't extensive and a lot of these files are just basic configurations for these self hosted services. 

If you're interested in self-hosting and would like to learn more I highly reccomend checking out reddit.com/r/selfhosted reddit.com/r/homelab or https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted

Its a deep rabbit hole but well worth the effort and time. Happy self-hosting!
